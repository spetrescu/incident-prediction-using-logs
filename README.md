# incident-prediction-using-logs

This repository contains code for extracting textual features from log data. 
Specifically, Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is applied to discover hidden features in concatenated log data. 
A training dataset is created by concatenating various logs in M documents. An LDA model is then trained
for extracting textual features in unseen data.
